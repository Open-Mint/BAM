BAM
Hello and welcome!

Bam is a simple game project where a player needs to click on the object on screen as fast as they can in order to gain points! The more points the better!
There is a timer, but currently there are no levels. I've got a couple of more updates to it in future, but not a lot. It's a simple game after all. It's
written in C++ using SFML([Simple Fast Multimedia Library](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)). It's got the makefile it needs.

If you have any suggestions about anything in code whether it is code specific(C++ or SFML) or about file organising or whatever, please let me know. I'll try
to fix it.

More projects incoming. Have fun :)
